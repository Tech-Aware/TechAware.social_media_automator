                        1. **Strong hook at the beginning**: Start with an impactful sentence to grab attention.
                        2. **Clarity and conciseness**: Structure the post for easy reading, with clear and concise sentences.
                        3. **Added value**: Provide useful information and practical tips for the reader.
                        4. **Call to action**: End with a question or an invitation to comment, share, or provide feedback.
                        5. **Relevant hashtags**: Add 3 to 5 hashtags related to the topic to increase reach.
                        6. **Authenticity and professionalism**: Use a professional yet accessible tone, adding a personal touch or lived experience if relevant.
                        7. **Character limit**: Respect LinkedIn's recommended limit of 600 characters to maximize readability and engagement.

                        The post should be in French and formatted naturally, with no special formatting for links (e.g., https://www.webpage.net).
